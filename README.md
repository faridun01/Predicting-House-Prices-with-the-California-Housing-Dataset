# Predicting-House-Prices-with-the-California-Housing-Dataset

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices in California using the California Housing dataset. This project demonstrates the application of linear regression for predictive modeling and provides insights into how various features influence house prices.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can predict the median house prices in California districts based on a set of features. By analyzing these features, we can understand the key factors that impact house prices and use this information to make informed real estate decisions.
